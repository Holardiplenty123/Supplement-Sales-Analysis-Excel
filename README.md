## Conclusion

The sales analysis from 2020 to 2025 reveals consistent growth in supplement sales across regions and platforms until a notable decline occurred in 2025. Canada emerged as the leading sales location, while iHerb proved to be the most profitable platform. Biotin Supplements stood out as the highest-selling product, highlighting strong consumer interest in wellness and beauty-related supplements.

Although the market showed stability over the years, the sudden drop in 2025 suggests emerging challenges that require prompt investigation. By focusing on high-performing regions, strengthening partnerships, promoting top-selling products, and analyzing the cause of the 2025 decline, the company can improve future sales performance and regain growth momentum.

## Recommendation

Based on the findings from the supplement sales analysis (2020–2025), the following recommendations are suggested to improve sales performance and strategic decision-making:

- Focus More Marketing and Distribution Efforts in Canada
Since Canada generated the highest total revenue, expanding product availability, targeted promotions, and customer engagement strategies in this region can further increase sales.

- Strengthen Partnership with iHerb
IHerb recorded the highest sales among platforms. Increasing product visibility, running exclusive deals, and negotiating better placement on the platform can maximize returns.

- Increase Stock and Promotion for Biotin Supplements
Biotin was the top-selling product. Maintaining adequate stock levels, bundling with complementary supplements, and highlighting product benefits can help boost revenue even more.

- Investigate the Revenue Decline in 2025
The sharp drop in revenue in 2025 signals a problem. A deeper analysis should be carried out to determine possible causes such as:

- Reduced consumer spending

- Stronger competition

- Supply chain issues

- Pricing or discount strategy changes
- Understanding the root cause will prevent further declines.

- Enhance Customer Retention Strategies
Using customer feedback, loyalty programs, and personalized marketing may help stabilize sales, especially in low-performing years.

- Optimize Pricing and Discount Strategies
Monitor how discount levels affect sales volume and revenue. Adjust pricing to maximize profit without losing customers.
